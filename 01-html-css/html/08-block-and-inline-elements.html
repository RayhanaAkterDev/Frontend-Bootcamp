    Purpose: Demonstrates the difference between block-level and inline HTML elements using practical examples.
    Concepts covered: <div> vs <span>, block vs inline behavior, layout vs text flow.
    Instructions: Open in a browser and use DevTools to inspect how each element behaves in the layout.

        <!-- ANCHOR: Block-level elements -->
        <div>
            This is a div element. It starts on a new line and takes up full
            width.
        </div>
        <p>
            This is a paragraph element. Like div, it is also block-level and
            breaks onto a new line.
        </p>

        <!-- ANCHOR: Inline elements -->
        <p>
            This sentence contains a <span>span element</span> and an
            <a href="#">anchor link</a>, both of which are inline and do not
            break the flow.
        </p>
